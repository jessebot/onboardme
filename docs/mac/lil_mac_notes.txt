## Finder
*Fun fact*: you can run defaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool YES && killall Finder command in the Terminal, after that you can exit Finder with âŒ˜Q just like any other app. It won't help to remove Finder from the Dock though.

To revert, run defaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool NO && killall Finder

This is such a pain, right? Why does mac want its dock to look so cluttered?
