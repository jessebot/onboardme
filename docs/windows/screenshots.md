## 📷 Key (Print Screen Key) mapped Snip & Sketch
Snip & Sketch is Microsoft's screenshoting tool, but it's not mapped to your "printscreen" key, because Windows is trash.

Hit the 🪟 key > Settings.

Type "Snip" in the settings bar, and you should get a prompt that says "Use the Print Screen key to launch screen snipping". Click prompt.

Scroll to the bottom of the page for "Print Screen Shortcut" and toggle to `On`.

This automatically saves snips to your clipboard, for pasting.

## Snip & Sketch save on close
Launch Snip & Sketch and go to the top right `...` button > ⚙️ Settings.

Under "Save snips (Ask to save my snip before closing)" toggle the botton to `on`.

Otherwise it will discard your snip when you close it.
