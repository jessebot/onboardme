## Welcome, lost friend

I use this as a personal wiki to remember how to do most things on a desktop or mobile device. The bulk of this is automated with my onboardme script, which you can learn more about [here](https://jessebot.github.io/onboardme/onboardme) on this little wiki, or you can go straight to the [source on github](https://github.com/jessebot/onboardme).


#### However...


**Every** operating system or platform has that one thing™️ that voids the [Is It Worth the Time](https://xkcd.com/1205/) rule, which leaves us in the weird place, where setting up the thing™️ manually is still faster than trying to keep the automation up to date as every OS changes over time, which is illustrated in the [Automation Chart](https://xkcd.com/1319/). So, I don't know that I'll ever have a perfect solution to map capslock to control in a simple automated manner on every OS, but that's just the systems engineer's mental burden: "I have the ability to do x, but do I really have the time or interest... to do it on windows, mac, linux, and android...?"

*That's where docs come in handy, because you can't even trust that you'll be able to re-web-search any thing™️ these days.*

Feel free to peruse and take anything you need. Good luck out there :)
