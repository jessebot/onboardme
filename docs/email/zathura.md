# Zathura

[Zathura] is an opensource hackable document viewer that allows complete control via the keyboard, instead of solely the mouse.

## Themes
You can customize the colorschemes of the documentviewer including the border colors.

I found a fun little program to to generate themes from your wallpaper,
[here](https://github.com/GideonWolfe/Zathura-Pywal)

### Installing

#### macOS
The project is mainly focused on Linux, but there's also some people maintaining [a homebrew tap] that will allow you to `brew install` it on macOS.
