# NeoMutt Attachments

## Displaying images in the terminal

Check this out for more info: [neomutt mimesupport](https://neomutt.org/guide/mimesupport)

On macOS, I'm using iterm2, so I use imgcat, but can't figure out why it
doesn't work in neomutt, so I'm instead just sixel there too:

```init
image/*; (clear && img2sixel %s); needsterminal
```


## Displaying html in the terminal


### w3m with no images directly in neomutt

Create `~/.config/neomutt/mailcap` with this line:

```bash
# I'm using sixel with w3m, but you could use any image renderer of your choice
text/html; w3m -sixel -o auto_image=TRUE -o display_image=1 -T text/html %s; nametemplate=%s.html; needsterminal; copiousoutput
```

### w3m with images in neomutt, but autoview doesn't work

Create `~/.config/neomutt/mailcap` with this line:

```bash
# I'm using sixel with w3m, but you could use any image renderer of your choice
text/html; w3m -sixel -o auto_image=TRUE -o display_image=1 -T text/html %s; nametemplate=%s.html
```

### Display images in neomutt, in an iterm2 split (macOS only)

This is a rat hole. TLDR; [neomutt does not support sixel] right now, so I
decided to write some stuff to open w3m with sixel in an iterm2 split to
avoid all the hassle.

There's basically no way to easily and quickly view an attachment in my particular situation where I don't want to press as many keys, so I wrote a couple of things to help out, first of all, I created a new profile in iterm2 called minimal, and it runs this as the startup command:

```bash
bash --noprofile --rcfile .bash_profile_minimal
```

`.bash_profile_minimal` just sets up my default PATH and nothing else,
so that I can still source homebrew installed applications such as w3m and sixel.

Then I wrote a small script to open w3m in a iterm2 new split using that profile,
and you can view it here (it's not terribly complicated, I wrote it in an or hour or so):
[w3m-splits](https://github.com/jessebot/dot_files/blob/main/.local/bin/w3m-splits)


Then I updated my mailcap file to have the following:

```bash
# for displaying html files in a new split in iterm2 with w3m and sixel
text/html; (clear && w3m-splits %s); nametemplate=%s.html
```

I also ended updating my `~/.w3m/config` to have the following
(that you can just hit q and it won't prompt for confirmation when quitting):

```bash
confirm_qq false
```

Finally, I needed a key map for this, because it still requires you to view the message, then view the attachments, then find the text/html mime type, and then select it. I found a neat little post on how to do this and implemented it like so:

```viml
# Unbinds V from version (which just printed the version of neomutt)
bind index,pager V  noop

# quick html view macro; won't mark message as read for some reason :shrug:
macro index,pager V "<view-attachments><search>html<enter><view-mailcap><exit><clear-flag>N"
```

Now when I want to view an email from the index (list of mail in mutt), I just hit `V`, and it opens a new pane in iterm2 with the rendered w3m email with images working via sixel. It takes maybe 2 full seconds to open an email in the split, but it has the images and it works and that's good enough for me on macOS right now.

Currently looking at creating a homebrew tap for zathura to do it even faster though I still wanted to document this, in case people find this when searching, because there's surprisingly very little out there for this hyper specific issue.
