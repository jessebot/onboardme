# Neovim plugins
This got long enough it needed it's own page

## Know issues
<details>
  <summary>Python3 Plugins</summary>

  If you run into a bunch of errors about vim not being compiled with python3,
  then you probably need to first install `pynvim`, which helps with this:

  ```bash
  # I use python3.10 everywhere right now, but you probably don't need to specify
  python3.10 -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim
  ```

  After that, all my plugins worked find as they do in vim.

## vim-plug
I have a [whole section on vim-plug under vim](https://jessebot.github.io/onboardme/vim/vim-plugins), but we have a few caveats if we
want to use it in neovim.

  <summary>Continuing to use vim-plug from vim</summary>

  ## Source Plugins for vim/neovim in the same location
  Having to install a package twice in two different locations is silly and makes
  maintanence and updates more of a chore. Pick a location, and stick with it,
  but to do this in vimscript with both an `init.vim` from neovim and a `.vimrc`
  being sourced for regular vim, we get into slightly more complicated territory,
  and kind of repetitive. The quick way I found was to have a section in your
  `.vimrc` like this:

  ```vim
  " this means: don't run this part in if we're using neovim
  if !has('nvim')

      call plug#begin()

      " put all your vim plugins here, but don't include anything that only
      " works in neovim (e.g. semshi)

      " plugin that works in vim/neovim: This is helpful for markdown
      Plug 'junegunn/limelight.vim'

      call plug#end()

  endif
  ```

  and then in your `init.vim`, have something like this AFTER you source your
  `.vimrc`, so that vim-plug knows where to source your plugin exactly:

  ```vim
  source ~/.vimrc

  call plug#begin()

  " plugin that works in vim/neovim but was installed with vim-plug in vim
  Plug 'junegunn/limelight.vim', {'dir': '~/.vim/plugged/limelight.vim'}

  " Example plugin that only works in neovim
  Plug 'numirias/semshi', { 'do': ':UpdateRemotePlugins' }

  call plug#end()
  ```

</details>

## Introducing Packer
You'll start seeing a lot of people talking about packer as you go on your neovim
journey. It's similar to vim-plug or vundle, but it's in pure lua. In your `init.lua`,
put the following:

```lua
require('plugins')
```

and then create a file in `~/.config/nvim/lua` called `plugins.lua` with the following:

```lua
-- This file can be loaded by calling `lua require('plugins')` from your init.vim

-- this function installs the packer plugin if it's not already installed
local ensure_packer = function()
  local fn = vim.fn
  local install_path = fn.stdpath('data')..'/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim'
  if fn.empty(fn.glob(install_path)) > 0 then
    fn.system({'git', 'clone', '--depth', '1', 'https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim', install_path})
    vim.cmd [[packadd packer.nvim]]
    return true
  end
  return false
end

-- this calls the above function
local packer_bootstrap = ensure_packer()

-- this manages your actual plugins
return require('packer').startup(function(use)

    -- Packer can manage itself
    use 'wbthomason/packer.nvim'

    -- Example plugin for if you already have a plugin installed in vim with
    -- something like vim-plug, like: Plug 'junegunn/limelight.vim'
    use '~/.vim/plugged/limelight.vim'


    -- Example plugin where we run :Updateremoteuseins after loadin the plugin
    -- and only run it on python filetypes.
    use {'numirias/semshi',  run = ':UpdateRemoteuseins', ft = 'py'}
    -- this would be like running this for vim-plug:
    -- Plug 'numirias/semshi', { 'do': ':UpdateRemoteuseins', 'filetype': 'py' }

    -- Automatically set up your configuration after cloning packer.nvim
    -- Put this at the end after all plugins
    if packer_bootstrap then
        require('packer').sync()
    end
end)
```

_Note: You can checkout my actual `plugins.lua` file [here](https://github.com/jessebot/dot_files/blob/main/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua)_

Finally, you can open up neovim and run: `:PackerCompile` and `:PackerInstall`
and you should be on your way :)

## writing little lua scripts

If you want to say, take this block from your `.vimrc`:

```vim
"                              FOLDING ZONE:
"                 "collapse an entire block or function"
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
" Enable folding on base indent
set foldmethod=indent
set foldlevel=99
" let spacebar allow me to fold the code
nnoremap <space> za
" also allow me to see the doc strings
let g:SimpylFold_docstring_preview=1
" enable folding for markdown?
let g:markdown_folding = 1
let g:indentLine_fileTypeExclude = ['dashboard']
```

and move it to your lua config for neovim, you may not want it cluttering your
`init.lua`, because it will be difficult to maintain that file. You can create
a directory structure in your `~/.config/nvim` directory like this:

```
# tree ~/.config/nvim

nvim
├── init.lua
└── lua
    └── user
        └── folding.lua
```

In there, you can see a  a file in the path of:
`~/.config/nvim/lua/user/folding.lua`

That file can then contain the same code from your `.vimrc` written in lua, like:

```lua
--                             FOLDING ZONE:
--                 collapse an entire block or function
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Enable folding on base indent
vim.opt.foldmethod = 'indent'
vim.opt.foldlevel = 99
-- also allow me to see the doc strings
vim.g.SimpylFold_docstring_preview=1
-- enable folding for markdown?
vim.g.markdown_folding = 1
vim.g.indentLine_fileTypeExclude = [['dashboard']]
```

Finally, to make sure that's sourced, include the following in your `init.lua`:

```lua
require('user.folding')
```

_Note: make sure you source your lua script AFTER your plugins that you're referencing from your package manager (vim-plug, packer, etc)._
