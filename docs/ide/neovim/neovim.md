# neovim
[Neovim](https://neovim.io) is 

> a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more. 

It's supposed to be faster than vim at a lot of things, and there's more 
extensible plugins and active communities, it would seem anyway, from my casual
observation over the past year-ish (it's October 2022 at the time of writing).

To be honest, I've been using vim since 2011, and even though neovim has been
around since 2015, since I was using vi before vim, I never really gave it a
ton of thought. But recently there finally came
[a plugin](https://github.com/numirias/semshi#readme) that looked too good
not to try, but was only available for neovim, so I figured, at very least,
I should give it a go. I'll document anything interesting I learn here.

# Getting Started with Neovim

You can install neovim with: `brew install neovim`

You can run neovim with: `nvim`

## Config

The config file is located at:

|        OS          |                   Location                     |
|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| Unix               | ~/.config/nvim/init.vim		(or init.lua)     |
| Windows            | ~/AppData/Local/nvim/init.vim	(or init.lua) |
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/nvim/init.vim	(or init.lua) |

And if you want to just get your vim stuff working, you want to these contents
in your `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`:

```vim
set runtimepath^=~/.vim runtimepath+=~/.vim/after
let &packpath = &runtimepath
source ~/.vimrc
```

After that, launch neovim with `nvim` and then do your normal plugin manager flow.

## Plugins 

Most plugins will work out of the box, but you'll probably have issues with
Python plugins. You can learn more about those and other things to do with vim-plug
and packer [here](https://jessebot.github.io/onboardme/neovim/plugins).

## Known issues between vim and neovim

If you get an error complaining about `bash\ --login`, then it's probably
because of this line in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
" this works in vim, but not neovim
set shell=bash\ --login
```

Fix it by changing the above to:

```vim
" this ignores neovim when setting shell
if !has('nvim')
    set shell=bash\ --login
endif
```

## init.lua
This file should be located in `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`, but you'll have to
create it. When you're in lua land, vim-plug becomes more difficult in weird ways
and the alternative does require a bit of a conversion, but it's worth it, I think,
because a lot of the latest trendy plugins are written in lua anyway, and you can
still source vimscript files.

### Converting an `init.vim`/`.vimrc` to an `init.lua`

#### setting variables

To start converting, you can fist grab all your variables, for instance:

```vim 
" enable line number column
set number = true
```

and put them directory into your `init.lua` file. Then run an interactive sed
to update them to lua's vim interface like this, `:%s/set number /vim.opt./`,
which should then give you this:

```lua
-- enable line number column
vim.opt.number = true
```

#### Remapping a key

Here's an example in my `.vimrc`:

```vim
" let spacebar allow me to fold the code
nnoremap <space> za
```

And here's what that translated to in my `init.lua`:

```lua
-- let spacebar allow me to fold the code
-- in vimscript, this was: nnoremap <space> za
vim.keymap.set('n', '<space>', 'za')
```

#### vim commands
Sometimes you have a command that doesn't have a vim lua interface, or maybe you
just can't find it. There's a `vim.cmd` you can call instead. Example:

I have my colorscheme set to [spacechalk](https://github.com/jessebot/space-chalk) in my `.vimrc` like this:

```vim
colorscheme spacechalk
```

The eqivelent in my `init.lua` is this:

```lua
vim.cmd [[colorscheme spacechalk]]
```
