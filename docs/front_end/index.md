# Frontend Stuff
I found [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68558955/bootstrap-centering-container-in-the-middle-of-the-page)
on vertically centering items and it helped a lot. Basically both the body and
base container you have need to be h-100 and vh-100 and for extra security,
add `min-height: 100vh;` to the CSS for the body.

## Fonts
My favorite fonts are the following:
- [Mononoki](http://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/) -  a font for programming and
  code review, but I use a patched version with nerdfonts, available
  [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

- [Cozette](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette) - bitmap programming font
  optimized for coziness 💜

### ICONS
I love a good icon/glyph for TUIs and webpages. Some of my favorites are:
- [nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
- [bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/#icons)
- [boxicons](https://boxicons.com/)

All of the above are open source and free of charge.
