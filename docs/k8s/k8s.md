# K8s stuff

Most of my k8s work is also open source with repos kind of scattered all over.

You can find things about kops [here](https://github.com/jessebot/terraform-kops-sample).

A small script to get a homelab up and running with KinD or K3s is located [here](https://github.com/jessebot/smol_k8s_lab) with docs [here](https://jessebot.github.io/smol_k8s_lab/). The docs have further notes for various apps you can run on k8s as well as full tutorials on k3s and KinD.

You can also find the stuff that runs on top of my homelab [here](https://gitlab.com/vleermuis_tech/goobernetes).
