# Tmux
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is an open-source terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. It is useful for running more than one command-line program at the same time. It can also be used to detach processes from their controlling terminals, allowing remote sessions to remain active without being visible.

## Start a new tmux session

```bash
tmux
```

## Attach to an existing tmux session

```bash
# Attach to the only tmux session
tmux attach
```
