# RDP

## RDP from macOS to Debian based distros

Make sure the remote ssh server supports X11. Make sure these lines are in your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file:

```sshconfig
X11Forwarding yes
X11UseLocalhost yes
```

Install an X11 server and an RDP client on your mac with:

```bash
brew install --cask xquartz
brew install freerdp
```

*Then you should reboot ðŸ¤·*

(Xquartz provides a telnet app which sets the `$DISPLAY` variable. This is why you reboot.)


Finally, you can use the freerdp client:

```bash
xfreerdp /u:youruser /p:yourpassword /v:hostnameoripaddr
```
