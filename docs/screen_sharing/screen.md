# `screen`

[screen](https://wikiless.org/wiki/GNU_Screen?lang=en), formally known as GNU Screen, is a terminal multiplexer, a software application that can be used to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple separate login sessions inside a single terminal window, or detach and reattach sessions from a terminal. It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for separating programs from the session of the Unix shell that started the program, particularly so a remote process continues running even when the user is disconnected.

Released under the terms of version 3 or later of the GNU General Public License, GNU Screen is free software.

# Start a `screen` session

```bash
screen
```

# Attach to an existing screen session

```bash
screen -x
```
