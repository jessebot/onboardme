# Home Automation Journey

Currently looked at [Home Asisstant](www.home-assistant.io) vs [openHAB](www.openhab.org). I haven't installed openHAB at all yet, because it looks like home asisstant is in Python vs openHAB being in Java. I know python better than java, and from everything I've looked at, home asisstant seems  to have better apps.
