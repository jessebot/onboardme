## Explanation of what, why, how when it comes to Terminals

| App | Local Config | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) | [~/Library/ApplicationSupport/iTerm2/DynamicProfiles/Profiles.json](https://github.com/jessebot/onboardme/configs/iterm2/Profiles.json) | configurable, highly supported | macOS only |
| [hyper.js](https://hyper.is/) | [~/.hyper.js](https://github.com/jessebot/onboardme/configs/dot_files/.hyper.js) | modern feel, configurable, cross platform | Slow, Javascript :( |
| [cmder](https://cmder.net/) | None yet | terminal for windows that scales, splits, and supports config | kinda buggy |

You can find more Hyper.js docs [here](./hyper/README.md), thanks to @cloudymax :)

## Tips and Tricks
When you're using nerdfonts, you want to set the font in the terminal config itself, and you want to set the encodeing to UTF-8
