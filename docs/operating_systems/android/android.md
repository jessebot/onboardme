## Some apps I use currently and why

I mostly use [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) to download opensource apps, but when I need something from the Google playstore, I use the [Aurora Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/). Each app below will have a link to where you can download it.
