## Under the hood

## Important Notes on Ethics

### FOSS
Here at this humble OnBoardMe repo, we try really hard to do the right thing. We're doing our best to get off of the giants like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Samsung, etc... but we've still got a long way to go! Check back here for alternatives as we go on the journey ourselves! We'll link back to any orgs or projects we learn about, but feel free to open an issue with anything else we should link back to. :)

  *Living ethically under late stage capitalism is not easy, but we believe generally that software should be [Free and Open Source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). If we can't have that, we'll take as close as possible.*

#### Humane Tech Lists
We've had good luck with [Awesome Humane Tech](https://github.com/humanetech-community/awesome-humane-tech) for guides and checking out alternatives to tech from the Giants you previously used.

#### Language
We are currently using the philosophy of this RFC draft:
[Terminology, Power, & Exclusionary Language...](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-knodel-terminology-10)

That same RFC also references a few tools you can use to fix your current environments, such as linters to be maintain inclusive language. TODO: pull them all and put them here.

### Tips
Contact your local datacenters and see if they offer an object storage service, because they might, and it could be really cheap. Don't give your money to AWS, Microsoft, or Google if you don't absolutely have to.

Looking for a project to get a fresh OS entirely, on a machine that has no OS?
Check out [pxeless](https://github.com/cloudymax/pxeless).
It works great in combination with onboardme :)
