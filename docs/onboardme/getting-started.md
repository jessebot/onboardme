# Quick Start

If you haven't already, please refer to the
[install instructions](https://jessebot.github.io/onboardme/onboardme/getting-started/installation) ðŸŒ±.

You can run `onboardme` with no options or further configuration, and it will
not overwrite anything, but it will install packages and attempt to configure
fonts, vim, and give you further instructions to setup your machine on your own.

See below for configuration with cli options or a config file :)

## Configuration

### CLI

For the full help, you can check out the `--help` option. If anything there is
unclear, please feel free to open up [an issue](https://github.com/onboardme/issues)
and we can clear it up for you and make the help text, more helpful :)

```bash
onboardme --help
```

### Config files

`onboardme` uses a `config.yaml` in its installation directory that has defaults.
Those defaults can be altered per machine by creating a config file like:

<details>
  <summary>`~/.config/onboardme/config.yml`</summary>

  ```yaml
  ---
  # ______________________________________________________________ #
  #         Config file for the onboardme cli command.             #
  # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #
  #  - This is the default config file that pip will install into: #
  #    $PYTHON_PATH/lib/onboardme/config/onboardme_config.yml      #
  #                                                                #
  #  - If this files exists as: ~/.config/onboardme/config.yaml    #
  #    then its loaded instead of the default config               #

We also use a package file called
[`packages.yml`](https://github.com/jessebot/onboardme/blob/main/onboardme/config/packages.yml)
which you can also place in your `~/.config/onboardme` directory, to take
precedence over our defaults.

## Config Sections and Explanations
### Steps
Steps refer to a specific function in the list of functions we run and can be
configured for both macOS and Linux seperately. These steps include:

- setting up dot files in your home directory (.bashrc, .vimrc, etc)
- setting up vim (installing vim-plug and vim plugins)
- managing packages using package managers (brew, pip3.11, apt, snap, flatpak)
- installing fonts
- setting up basic TUI IDEs, vim/neovim
- setting up groups

They can be configured via the `steps` parameter in the `config.yml` above,
or via the the cli like:

```bash
# this runs only the dot_file management step
onboardme -s dot_files
```

or for multiple steps:

```bash
# this runs both the dot_file management step and the vim setup step
onboardme -s dot_files -s vim_setup
```

If you try to run a step that requires another step, we will automatically run
that step so for instance, to set up vim, we need dot files. e.g.

This command: `onboardme -s vim_setup`

In the background becomes: `onboardme -s dot_files -s vim_setup`

### dot files
The dot files for your home directory are installed from a git URL and branch
that you can configure either via the config file, or the cli. If your local
files conflict with the files in the repo, we will not overwrite them by default.
If you always want your local dot files overwritten, you can pass in the `-O` switch
or `--overwrite` option or set `overwrite` in your local `~/.config/onboardme/config.yml`.

### `onboardme` cli
```bash
# run onboardme with a custom git url and branch that overwrites existing files
onboardme --git_url https://github.com/jessebot/dot_files.git --git_branch main --overwrite
```

### `config.yml`

```yaml
dot_files:
  git_url: "https://github.com/jessebot/dot_files.git"
  git_branch: "main"
  overwrite: true
```


### Package Management
All of the packages are installed using package managers, and each package
manager has groups of packages they can install. You can specify specific
package _managers_ and package _groups_ via the `config.yml` file, or via the cli.

By default, we install the `default` package _groups_ for all package _managers_.
This includes everything you need for a basic cli experience and a slim ide.

The default package managers for macOS and Linux are: `brew` and `pip3.11`

For Linux, we also include: `apt`, `snap`, and `flatpak`

See the examples below:

#### Install the "default" and "gui" package groups
This would install the default packages for the basic cli experience and a
slim ide PLUS GUI tools, like vlc and freetube.

##### `onboardme` cli

```bash
# can also be: onboardme -g default -g gui
onboardme --pkg_groups default --pkg_groups gui
```

##### `config.yml`

```yaml
package:
  groups:
    - default
    - gui
```

#### _Only_ install the "devops" package group for _only_ the `brew` package manager
This will install only additional tooling for devops work.
_Note: This will not install/upgrade the default package group._

##### `onboardme` cli

```bash
# can also be: onboardme -p brew -g devops
onboardme --pkg_managers brew --pkg_groups devops
```

##### `config.yml`

```yaml
package:
  managers:
      Darwin:
        - brew
      Linux:
        - brew
  groups:
    - devops
```
