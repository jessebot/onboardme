# Quick Start

If you haven't already, please refer to the 🌱
[install instructions](https://jessebot.github.io/onboardme/onboardme/getting-started/installation) and ⚙️ [Configuration](https://jessebot.github.io/onboardme/onboardme/config).

You can run `onboardme` with no options or further configuration, and it will
not overwrite anything, but it will install packages and attempt to configure
fonts, neovim, and give you further instructions to setup your machine on your own.

```bash
onboardme
```
