## TODOs and sort of Roadmap
- allow to only update rc files
- add ci/cd and automatic releases/release notes
- fix jekyll site to look less gross

Additional todos can generally be found in the github issues [here](https://github.com/jessebot/onboardme/issues).

I should probably write something to automatically just update this page with todos directly from the issues. Will maybe write simple github action for that later.
