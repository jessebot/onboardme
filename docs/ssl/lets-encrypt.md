## Installing cmctl, the cli tool for cert-manager
This should probably move to onboardme....

You'll need to download the tar ball for your OS [here](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases) and then untar it, and move it into a directory in your `$PATH`. MacOS will fail the first time you run it, and you'll need to go into System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Allow apps downloaded from, to allow an exception.
