# Vim
Welcome to the wacky world of [Vim](https://www.vim.org/),

> a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.

Vim is my daily driver for text editing. It serves as my [IDE](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) which includes most bells and whistles of any other editor, but with a WAY smaller footprint. Vim can do anything that visual studio or atom or pycharm or whatever the kids are using these days, but it's generally going to be more barebones, and that's a good thing, because you don't need a new computer every other year to keep up with how bloated your current IDE is. You need a better IDE.

Here's a peak at what it looks like to work in vim:

(Fun fact: typing `:term` will make a terminal appear without leaving vim)

## Vim Tips and Tricks

### Vim tutor

Type `vimtutor` anywhere vim is installed to try out a vim tutorial.
Per the vim docs (`:help vimtutor`):

```
==============================================================================
01.3    Using the Vim tutor                             tutor vimtutor

Instead of reading the text (boring!) you can use the vimtutor to learn your
first Vim commands.  This is a 30-minute tutorial that teaches the most basic
Vim functionality hands-on.

On Unix, if Vim has been properly installed, you can start it from the shell:

        vimtutor

On MS-Windows you can find it in the Program/Vim menu.  Or execute
vimtutor.bat in the $VIMRUNTIME directory.

This will make a copy of the tutor file, so that you can edit it without
the risk of damaging the original.
   There are a few translated versions of the tutor.  To find out if yours is
available, use the two-letter language code.  For French:

        vimtutor fr
```

### Navigation 

|Keys|Description|
|:---:|:---|
|`gg`| top of the file|
|`shift` + `g`| bottom of the file|

You can type a number before any of these to increase how far they go, e.g. `2j` will take you to down two lines.

|Keys|Description|
|:---:|:---|
|`j`| down a line|
|`k`| up a line|
|`h`| left a character|
|`l`| right a character|

### Copying, Pasting, Deleting

You can type a number before all of these hot keys to change the number of lines or words you cut, copy, and paste.

|Keys|Description|
|:---:|:---|
|`y`| copy the current selection (only in visual mode) |
|`yy`| copy the current line |
|`yw`| copy the current word |
|`dw`| cut the current word (deletes and puts in clipboard)|
|`dd`| cut the current line (deletes and puts in clipboard)|
|`p` | paste a line or selection |
|`]p` | paste a line or selection to match current indentation|

:star2: the `y` you're typing stands for "yank", so you're yanking a line. 

### Indent and Unindent

|Keys|Description|
|:---:|:---|
| `>>` | Indent current line *or* selection |
| `<<` | Unindent current line *or* selection |
| `2>>` | Indent current line *or* selection **twice** |
| `2<<` | Unindent current line *or* selection **twice** |

*Note: `shiftwidth` setting in your `.vimrc` controls how many spaces to indent.*

##### Indent curly brace block
Move your cursor over *one of the curly braces*, then hit `>` followed by `%`

(From anywhere inside the curly brace block you can hit: `>` then `i` then `B`.)

### Visual modes

|Keys|Description|
|:---:|:---|
|`v`          | Enter *v*isual mode - highlight multiple characters from left to right `h`,`l` |
|`shift` + `v`| Enter *V*isual (capital V) mode - highlight multiple lines up and down with `j`,`k` |
|`ctrl` + `v` | Enter Visual**Block** mode - highlight a visual block of character and lines in all directions with `j`,`k`,`l`,`h` |

Once you've highlighted a selection, you can then operate on just that selection, so you can cut it, copy it, indent it, and use interactive sed on it. It's pretty helpful.

#### Insert into all selected visualblock lines
After you have a visual block selected:
`shift` + `i` takes you into insert for all lines, and you can type whatever you want, including indentation like spaces or tabs.

*NOTE: It will only look like you're editing one line, and that is ok!*

Hit `esc` **twice**!

#### Interactive sed example
This will prepend each line with "meep ":
```vim
:%s/^/meep /
```

### Terminal
In command mode...

| Keys | Description |
|:---:|:---|
|`:term`| splits the current window horizonitally and puts the terminal on **TOP** of the current window |
|`:vertical term`| splits the current window vertically and puts the terminal to the **LEFT** of the current window |
|`:below term`| To get a terminal on the **BOTTOM OF THE ACTIVE PANE** |
|`:botright term`|To get a terminal that spans the **ENTIRE BOTTOM** |

### Navigate through windows 
**While Holding the `Ctrl` key,** type one to switch windows in vim:

| Keys | Description |
|:---:|:---|
|`ww`| cycle though all windows (I actually just use this one all the time and nothing else) |
|`wh`| takes you left a window  |
|`wj`| takes you down a window  |
|`wk`| takes you up a window    |
|`wl`| takes you right a window |
