# Sieve Filter Scripts
I can't believe I didn't just standardize these so I can burn emails at will. Live and learn.

Anyway, here you'll find some basic filters to categorize the mundane adult stuff when you move to a new email provider or start hosting your own :)

I live in the Netherlands, so some of the filters contain dutch domains and phrases.

### But What is Sieve though?
TLDR; Sieve is a programming language used to filter emails.

You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_(mail_filtering_language)) and Proton's support page has a pretty good breakdown [here](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/sieve-advanced-custom-filters/)
