# OnBoardMe
A project to store config files, as well as programatically install core packages accross several package managers that I need for development. A lot of this was amassed from many years of quickly looking into a thing‚Ñ¢Ô∏è , jotting it down, and then just hoping I'd remember why it was there later, so this is now a renewed effort in remembering all the thing‚Ñ¢Ô∏ès, and automating as much as possible. The idea is that it's faster, smaller, and easier to configure than it's ansible equivalent.

üöß Later beta state :3 Currently tested on macOS Monterey 12.4, and Debian 11 (Bullseye).
Please report üêõ in the GitHub issues, and I will get them as I have time.

Looking for a project to get a fresh OS entirely? Check out [pxeless](https://github.com/cloudymax/pxeless).

## Quick Start
First, make sure you have curl, but it *should* be there ***already be on macOS Monterey***:
```bash
# if this doesn't return anything, you need to install curl
which curl
```
If it's not there on Linux, you can install it with `apt` or use any default package manager like yum, or whatever people who use gentoo use
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install -y curl
```
Download and run the setup script to install git, brew, python, and python dependencies. The `setup.sh` will ask for your password to install things. Run the following from your home directory:
```bash
# Download the setup.sh; you may have to install curl, see above codeblock
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessebot/onboardme/main/setup.sh
# give it execute permissions
chmod 0500 ./setup.sh
# run the script, to install dependencies and clone the onboardme repo
. ./setup.sh
```

Now you can run the actual script that does the heavy lifting. If you can `setup.sh` above without errors, it will be installed in `~/repos/onboardme`:
```bash
# This will display a help
./repos/onboardme/onboardme.py --help

# this will run the script with no options
./repos/onboardme/onboardme.py
```

When the script completes, it'll output a number of other steps to take manually that aren't yet, or can't be, automated.

## Under the hood
- Installs files are in the directory `configs/rc_files`: `.bashrc` files, `.vimrc`, `.zshrc`, and `.hyper.js`.
- Installs apt, snap, and flatpak packages from `./configs/installers/packages.yml`
- Installs gaming related packages via apt if you pass in `--extras gaming`.
- Installs brew files from `./configs/installers/brew/Brewfile_*` depending on OS
- Installs vim-plug, a vim plugin manager to setup things like nerdtree, indentations lines, and fuzzysearch
- Configures iptables to block traffic on most ports except for HTTPS as well as ICMP/SSH for a single IP

If you want to see the exact packages being installed, you can check out `configs/installers/packages.yml` for an easy to absorb yaml list of packages per installer. I bias towards brew fo cross-platform usage, and those packages are avavailble as Brewfiles in `configs/installers/brew/`.

I'm using github issues to track future work on this thing.

## Things the scripts don't do
**Every** operating system has that one thing‚Ñ¢Ô∏è that voids the [Is It Worth the Time](https://xkcd.com/1205/) rule, which leaves us in the weird place, where setting up the thing‚Ñ¢Ô∏è manually is still faster than trying to keep the automation up to date as every OS changes over time, which is illustrated in the [Automation Chart](https://xkcd.com/1319/). So, I don't know that I'll ever have a perfect solution to map capslock to control in a simple automated manner on every OS, but that's just the systems engineer's mental burden: "I have the ability to do x, but do I really have the time or interest... to do it on windows, mac, linux, and android...?"

*That's where docs come in handy, because you can't even trust that you'll be able to re-web-search any thing‚Ñ¢Ô∏è these days.*

#### Docs
You can find the bulk of my notes under the `docs/` directory in this repo, but the goal is to get into some sort of wiki somewhere... soonish. Probably something like a little flask app with some sort of material design and a markdown plugin, because I don't have time for frontend at this stage of my life.

## Important Notes on FOSS and Ethics
Here at this humble OnBoardMe repo, we try really hard to do the right thing. We're doing our best to get off of the giants like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Samsung, etc... but we've still got a long way to go! Check back here for alternatives as we go on the journey ourselves! We'll link back to any orgs or projects we learn about, but feel free to open an issue with anything else we should link back to. :)

  Living ethically under late stage capitalism is not easy, but we believe generally that software should be Free and Open Source.

#### What is (FOSS), Free and Open Source Software
We believe in free software, and we do our best to use and support actually free and open source software. If you don't know what we mean, please check out this [GNU article on Free SoftWare](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).

#### Humane Tech Lists
We've had good luck with [Awesome Humane Tech](https://github.com/humanetech-community/awesome-humane-tech) for guides and checking out alternatives to tech from the Giants you previously used.

#### Language
We are currently using the philosophy of this RFC draft:
[Terminology, Power, & Exclusionary Language...](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-knodel-terminology-09)

### Tips
Contact your local datacenters and see if they offer an object storage service, because they might, and it could be really cheap. Don't give your money to AWS, Microsoft, or Google.

### Special Thanks
Thank you to @cloudymax for all their direct contributions for gaming on Linux, virtualization, and the hyper terminal configs. Also great engineer to rubberduck with generally. Couldn't have polished a lot of this without their patience during my late night ramblings about my 8 different package managers and why utf-8 isn't called utf-14 :3 :blue_heart:
