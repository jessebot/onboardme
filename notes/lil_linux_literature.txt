## UFW notes
Need to get `$remote_ip` at time of running if this is being set up as a secondary machine
```bash
ufw allow from $remote_ip to any port 22
```

This is to create special firewall configs for annoying apps want to phone home while they're supposed to be not running:
```bash
ufw app list
# move special app 
cp ufw/* /etc/ufw/applications.d
ufw app update discord
ufw app info discord
ufw deny discord
```
